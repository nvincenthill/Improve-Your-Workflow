## The 10x developer and you

According to Techopedia, "A 10x developer is an individual who is thought to be as productive as 10 others in his or her field. The 10x developer would produce 10 times the outcomes of other colleagues, in a production, engineering or software design environment."

This mythical person likely has many advantages (genetic, environmental, etc.) that lead them to produce an order of magnitude more than their colleagues. Some of those things you can change/improve about yourself and some you can't.

**The speed and efficiency of your workflow is something everyone can improve.**

## Deliberate Practice

This is how anyone improves at any skill or technique.

To improve your workflow you need to deliberately implement and practice the new ideas and techniques. Take the time to learn scary new shortcuts and commands.

Think to yourself- is there a faster/better/stronger way to do what I'm about to do in my text editor. Find the faster method and incorporate it into your workflow.

## A few words about Vim

Fuck Vim.
